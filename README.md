-   **Dynamic Header:** The header is fixed to the top and dynamically gets a shadow on scroll for better visibility.
-   **Smooth Scrolling & Active Link Highlighting:** Clicking navigation links smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section, and the active link is automatically highlighted based on the user's scroll position.
-   **On-Scroll Fade-In Animations:** Elements elegantly fade into view as they enter the viewport, implemented efficiently with the Intersection Observer API.
-   **Clean & Modern UI:** A visually appealing design with a consistent color scheme, modern fonts, and plenty of white space.

## Tech Stack

This project was built using core front-end technologies with a focus on writing clean, maintainable code without external frameworks.

-   **HTML5:** Structured with semantic elements for better accessibility and SEO.
-   **CSS3:**
    -   **Flexbox & Grid:** Used for creating robust and flexible layouts.
    -   **Mobile-First Approach:** Styles are built for mobile and scaled up with `@media` queries.
    -   **CSS Variables:** For an easily maintainable and themable color scheme and layout properties.
    -   **Transitions & Animations:** For smooth interactive effects and scroll animations.
-   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6):**
    -   **DOM Manipulation:** To toggle classes and dynamically update the UI.
    -   **Event Listeners:** To handle user interactions like clicks and scrolls.
    -   **Intersection Observer API:** Used for performance-optimized scroll animations, which is more efficient than using a traditional `onscroll` event listener.
